REMARKS:

ANSWERS:
Part 1:
1.
    a. sigsetjmp saves the current state of the thread \ program and returns a value that can be used later by
       siglongjmp to continue the execution of the program \ thread from the same point.

    b. sigsetjmp and siglongjmp can mask or unmask  signals, meaning they determine whether signals that erupt while
    the program is running will be handled or be blocked until the current thread will finish its execution;

2. we want to use User-level threads when multiple tasks need to be performed simultaneously within a single
process, such as in a web server there we have multiple requests in the same time. User-level threads are a
reasonable choice in our exercise because they can be managed by the application and don't use the operation system
resources, so they can do context switching faster and with lower overhead.

3. Advantages - more secure, because the processes are less connected. also they can be less affected from each other,
which mean that if one tab crash it doesn't affect other tabs.
 Disadvantages - worse performances, because of the overhead of the different processes. The synchronization between
 the tabs is more complex;

4. - typing the keyboard sends a hardware interrupt to the operation system. the os send it to the process to execute
the command typed. the command "kill <pid>" sends SIGTERM (terminate signal) to the program with this pid. The os, by
 its signals handler, terminate the process.


5. real time is the actual time that passed through the whole process. Virtual time is the time in specific thread
 was executed, without all the overhead like context switches.
 for example - we use real time to measure the time for user respond, like clicking on a button.
 we will use virtual time to measure huw much time it takes to process make a complex mathematical task.
